* Google Forms were used for getting feedback from the users.
* Prevented user's for accessing Rosetta's code
* The evaluation was based on whether the user was able to find the bug, fix the bug and time taken to fix it.
* Instructions on how to run code for each langauge in repl.it was provided in the README.md
## Materials

* Zoom
* Google Forms
* Digital Timers
